I've created an app using AndroidStudio app and coded using kotlin style.
The name of the app is Easy Dining!

This app is about having to select different types of food according to the type of day you choose.
This app also contains the food options that you would like to choose according to the time of day that you would love to have or choose.
The type f options a user should insert when finiding food suggestions:
- Morning
- Mid-Morning
- Afternoon
- Mid-Afternoon
- Night
- Dessert
It also contain of two buttons that you click doing a certain function, one button you click displays the food options according to the time of day that you chose,
the other button is the remove button, when you click the button it removes data so that you can choose again if you would love to select another option
When you've inserted incorrect data the buttons won't work instead it will how you that you typed wrong information as you must strictly type correct data for you
to get food suggestions that you would love to have
You can install your app on your Android mobile device by downloading the app on Play Store and other app downloading platforms
